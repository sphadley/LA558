    <li>Use use proj4js to convert detailed shape or geojson data to enhance the map</li>
    <li>Use proj4js to convert aerial photography to be integrated into a map layer</li>
    <li>Use usgs soil and elevation data to determine which acres to plant different crops on and then use turf to measure the area and determine how much of each type of seed to purchase</li>
